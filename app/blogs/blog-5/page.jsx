              You will be perfectly safe in your campervan. I see many of them
              parked near the gardens here in Taroudant. Yes of course very safe
              all around the country following the national and highways, so no
              problem just avoid and skip some of the off roads and you'll be
              fine.Nov 21, 2014

              However, we thinkÂ it is safe to drive in Morocco as long as you
              follow the traffic rules, pay attention, and drive carefully,
              especially in and around cities and off-the-beaten-track rural
              areas. In this post, we'll be sharing all our top tips for driving
              in Morocco safely so you can focus on having an amazing trip.

              Keep your doors locked all the time, whether you're inside the van
              or sleeping. This applies both when you're camping in remote areas
              and populated towns. When you keep your vehicle securely locked,
              you reduce the risk of intruders entering your space.
